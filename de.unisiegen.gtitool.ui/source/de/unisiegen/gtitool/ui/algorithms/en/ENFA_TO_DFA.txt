Let A = (Σ,Q,s,F,Δ) be the ε-NFA.

First generate the ε-Closure E(p) to each state p ∈ Q:
E(p) = {q ∈ Q | (p,ε) ⊢* (q,ε)}

The power set automaton is A' = (Σ,Q',s',F',δ), with
- Q' = p(Q), the power set of Q
- s' = {s}
- F' = {P ∈ p(Q) | E(P) ∩ F ≠ ∅}
- δ: p(Q) x Σ -> p(Q)
  δ(P,a) = {q ∈ Q | there is a p ∈ E(P) with (p,a,q) ∈ Δ}
  
Only the reachable states are shown.
