Let A = (Σ,Q,s,F,Δ) be a ε-NFA.

First generate the ε-Closure E(p) to each state p ∈ Q:
E(p) = {q ∈ Q | (p,ε) ⊢* (q,ε)}

Then generate the set I with the important states of A.
(A state is important, when at least one transition goes
from it with a symbol a ∈ Σ)

A' = (Σ,Q',S',F,Δ') is the equivalent NFA to A, with:
- Q' = I U F
- S' = {p ∈ Q' | p ∈ E(s)}
- Δ' = {(p,a,q) | p,q ∈ Q' and a ∈ Σ and there is a r ∈ Q.
        so that (p,a,r) ∈ Δ and q ∈ E(r)}
  
Only the reachable states are shown.
