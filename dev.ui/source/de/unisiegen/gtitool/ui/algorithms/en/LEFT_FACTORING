When ɑ is the longest common prefix of 2 (or more) productions
with left side A.
Let A -> ɑβ1|...|ɑβn|ˠ1|...|ˠk be all productions of A, 
where the ˠs start not with ɑ (n > 1, k >= 0). 
Replace these productions with:
A -> ɑA'|ˠ1|...|ˠn
A'-> β1|...|βn (Because ɑ is the longest common prefix, no 2 βi’s 
                  have a common prefix, that means A' is Ok)
with new nonterminal A'.
